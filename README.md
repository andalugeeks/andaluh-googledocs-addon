# andaluh-googledocs-addon

A side panel add-on for Google Docs (Google Drive) to help you transliterating espaÃ±ol (spanish) spelling to andaluz proposals. It imports [andaluh-gs](https://github.com/andalugeeks/andaluh-js/tree/google-apps-script) library, already hosted at Google Apps Script.

## Description

The **Andalusian varieties of [Spanish]** (Spanish: *andaluz*; Andalusian) are spoken in Andalusia, Ceuta, Melilla, and Gibraltar. They include perhaps the most distinct of the southern variants of peninsular Spanish, differing in many respects from northern varieties, and also from Standard Spanish. Further info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusian_Spanish.

This package introduces transliteration functions to convert *espaÃ±ol* (spanish) spelling to andaluz. As there's no official or standard andaluz spelling, andaluh-js is adopting the **EPA proposal (EstÃ¡ndar Pal Andaluz)**. Further info: https://andaluhepa.wordpress.com. Other andaluz spelling proposals are planned to be added as well.

## Installation

Automate the installation with Google Apps Script `clasp` tool. Use the `package.json` file and `npm` to install such dependencies. You'll need having `npm` tool from `nodejs` already installed. But you can also install `clasp` with a different method (check https://github.com/google/clasp).

```
$ npm install
```

Login. An OAuth-like authentication window will be opened in your browser:

```
$ clasp login

Logging in globally...
(node:1428169) ExperimentalWarning: The fs.promises API is experimental
ðŸ”‘ Authorize clasp by visiting this url:
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?access_type=offline[...]

Authorization successful.

Default credentials saved to: ~/.clasprc.json
```

Create a `google docs` project with `clasp` as well. A google apps script project will be created to host the source code (we will push the source code after).

```
$ clasp create --type docs --title Andaluh-GoogleDocs --rootDir ./src
(node:1429190) ExperimentalWarning: The fs.promises API is experimental

Created new Google Doc: https://drive.google.com/open?id=[...]
Created new Google Docs Add-on script: https://script.google.com/d/[...]/edit
```

Note the two links prompted. Push the source code to the google apps script project created and you're ready to go!

```
$ clasp push
