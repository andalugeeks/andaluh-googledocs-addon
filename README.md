# andaluh-googledocs-addon

A side panel add-on for Google Docs (Google Drive) to help you transliterating español (spanish) spelling to andaluz proposals. It uses a fork from [andaluh-gs](https://github.com/andalugeeks/andaluh-js/tree/google-apps-script) library, already embedded under `src/andaluhgs`.

## Description

The **Andalusian varieties of [Spanish]** (Spanish: *andaluz*; Andalusian) are spoken in Andalusia, Ceuta, Melilla, and Gibraltar. They include perhaps the most distinct of the southern variants of peninsular Spanish, differing in many respects from northern varieties, and also from Standard Spanish. Further info: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andalusian_Spanish.

This package introduces transliteration functions to convert *español* (spanish) spelling to andaluz. As there's no official or standard andaluz spelling, andaluh-js is adopting the **EPA proposal (Estándar Pal Andaluz)**. Further info: https://andaluhepa.wordpress.com. Other andaluz spelling proposals are planned to be added as well.

## Installation

Automate the installation with Google Apps Script `clasp` tool. Use the `package.json` file and `npm` to install such dependencies. You'll need having `npm` tool from `nodejs` already installed. But you can also install `clasp` with a different method (check https://github.com/google/clasp).

```
$ npm install
```

Login. An OAuth-like authentication window will be opened in your browser:

```
$ clasp login

Logging in globally...
(node:1428169) ExperimentalWarning: The fs.promises API is experimental
🔑 Authorize clasp by visiting this url:
https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/v2/auth?access_type=offline[...]

Authorization successful.

Default credentials saved to: ~/.clasprc.json
```

Create a `google docs` project with `clasp` as well. A google apps script project will be created to host the source code (we will push the source code after).

```
$ clasp create --type docs --title Andaluh-GoogleDocs --rootDir ./src
(node:1429190) ExperimentalWarning: The fs.promises API is experimental

Created new Google Doc: https://drive.google.com/open?id=[...]
Created new Google Docs Add-on script: https://script.google.com/d/[...]/edit
```

Note the two links prompted. Push the source code to the google apps script project created and you're ready to go!

```
$ clasp push

## Development

To use a different [andaluh-gs](https://github.com/andalugeeks/andaluh-js/tree/google-apps-script) transcription library version you've two options

* Edit the files under `src/andaluhgs`
* Deploy your own `andaluhgs` as a Google App Script. Then remove the files under `src/andaluhgs` and add your own `andaluhgs` library as a dependency on the `appscript.json` file (further reference on how to edit the `appscript.json` file here: https://developers.google.com/apps-script/manifest/dependencies).

## Roadmap

* Adding more andaluh spelling proposals.
* Contractions and inter-word interaction rules pending to be implemented.
* Silent /h/ sounds spelling rules pending to be implemented.
* Some spelling intervowel /d/ rules are still pending to be implemented.
* Transliteration rules for some consonant ending words still pending to be implemented.
